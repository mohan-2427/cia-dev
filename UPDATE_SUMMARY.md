  - Company stage and category badges

## How to Populate Real Data from Excel

### For Sheet1 (Supplier Details):
**File to Update**: `suppliers.html`

**Find these placeholders and replace with actual data**:
```
[Company Name from Sheet1] → Replace with actual company names
[Founder Name from Sheet1] → Replace with actual founder names
[Product Description from Sheet1] → Replace with product descriptions
[Contact Details from Sheet1] → Replace with phone/email
[Address from Sheet1] → Replace with actual addresses
```

### For Sheets 2-10 (Categories):
**File to Update**: `index.html` (Categories section)

**Current categories can be replaced with actual sector data from your Excel sheets**

## Next Steps

1. **Extract Excel Data**: Due to system restrictions, I couldn't directly access your Excel file. You'll need to:
   - Extract data from Sheet1 for company details
   - Extract category data from Sheets 2-10
   - Replace the placeholder text in the templates I've created

2. **Image Updates**: Consider updating the hero section images to match your startup/incubation theme

3. **Category Customization**: Replace the generic startup categories with the specific sectors from your Excel data

## Files Modified

- `index.html` - Main page with updated categories and hero section
- `suppliers.html` - Updated to show incubated companies with template structure
- Both pages now reflect the incubation/startup theme rather than machinery

## Template Structure Created

The website now has a proper structure for:
- ✅ Company listings with founder information
- ✅ Sector-based categorization
- ✅ Contact information display
- ✅ Startup-focused design and messaging
- ✅ Professional incubation hub appearance

To complete the implementation, simply replace the placeholder text with your actual Excel data following the structure I've provided.
